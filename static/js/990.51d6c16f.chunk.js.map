This stage is marked by the continuous application of the principles\n            and guidelines established in the previous phases, with a focus on the controlled expansion\n            of the architecture adoption in different areas of the system.\n            During the Expansion phase, the decisions made in the Initial Assessment and Practical\n            Implementation continue to shape the development team&apos;s journey. The goal is to scale the\n            application of the Micro-Frontends architecture, ensuring a smooth transition and minimizing\n            associated risks.\n           \n            </div>\n\n            <img src={ExpnsaoImg} alt=\"Expansion\" className=\"img-fluid mb-3 center-img\"  />\n            <div className='mb-4'>\n            This phase encompasses everything from selecting pilot projects to expanding to other\n            components of the system. Practical aspects, continuous learning, team training, and constant\n            monitoring are key elements to ensure the success of the expansion. The team is encouraged to\n            collect feedback, make adjustments to the strategy as necessary, and continuously improve the\n            implementation based on lessons learned throughout the process.
