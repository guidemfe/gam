This evaluation is subdivided into two distinct moments: Technical Feasibilities and Managerial Feasibilities. It is essential to highlight that the technical Viability study precedes the managerial Viability study. This approach ensures that management has sufficient artifacts and information to analyze, for example, the costs associated with the transition, contributing to a well-founded decision. The figure below illustrates the flow of the necessary analyses for the team to decide on the adoption of the architecture.\n            </div>\n            <img src={ViabilityImg} alt=\"Viability\" className=\"img-fluid mb-3 center-img\" />\n        </p>\n      </section>\n\n      </CCardBody>\n    </CCard>\n    </CCol>\n  </CRow>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default IntroductionViabilities\n"],"names":["IntroductionViabilities","_jsx","CRow","children","CCol","xs","CCard","className","CCardBody","_jsxs","src","ViabilityImg","alt"],"sourceRoot":""}
