Each phase is divided into its own dedicated page, making it easy to follow and implement the steps sequentially.</p>\n            <p>Although each phase (or sub-phase) can represent up to 100% of the suggested recommendations, it is important to note that it is not necessary to apply all of them, as each project has its specificities. However, the closer the implementation is to 100%, the greater the likelihood of the project&apos;s success.</p>\n            <h6><strong>Phase Breakdown</strong></h6>\n            <p>\n            Each phase (Viability Study, Implementation, Expansion, and Pilot Project) is comprehensively detailed on separate pages. As you progress through the guide, you will encounter specific recommendations and best practices tailored to that phase. These recommendations are designed to help you implement the micro-frontends architecture efficiently and effectively.\n            </p>\n            <h6>\n            <strong>Interactive Recommendations</strong> \n            <p>\n            To facilitate your progress, each recommendation within the guide is interactive. You can select the recommendations you have implemented, which helps you keep track of your progress.
